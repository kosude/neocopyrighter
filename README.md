NeoCopyrighter is a more recent and customisable rewrite of FordLabs' [Copyrighter](https://github.com/max-wilkinson/copyrighter/) extension. It
is a VS Code extension that automatically includes copyright and licence notices in source files.

For an official TO-DO list, see the [TODO](https://github.com/kosude/neocopyrighter-vsc/blob/master/TODO.md) file on GitHub.
